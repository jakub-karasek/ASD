Your task is to determine the number of k-inversions in the given permutation.

## Input:

The first line of the input contains two integers 
𝑛
n and 
𝑘
k (1 ≤ 
𝑛
n ≤ 20,000, 2 ≤ 
𝑘
k ≤ 10). The second line contains a permutation of the numbers from {1, . . . , n}.

## Output:

Your program should output the remainder of the number of k-inversions in the given permutation when divided by 
1
0
9
10 
9
 .

## Example:

For the input:

```
4 3
4 3 1 2
```

The correct output is:

```
2
```

For the input:

```
6 3
6 5 3 1 4 2
```

The correct output is:

```
10
```
